# Downloads #

Our new download page is <font color='purple'><b><a href='http://opendatakit.org/downloads'>here</a></b></font>.

Our downloads are now hosted on Google Drive, which scans all downloads for viruses.

When you download any of the ODK Aggregate installers, you will see a warning message that Google Drive is unable to scan the download for viruses because of its size, and it will ask you to "Download anyway" to proceed with the download. Apologies for the need for the extra click.

Why the change?

This website has discontinued its support for hosting file downloads. We have deleted the downloads that were present on this site to avoid confusion. All significant releases of our tools over the last 2 years have been moved to the new downloads area.
