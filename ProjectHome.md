Open Data Kit (ODK) is a free and open-source set tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to:
  * [Build](http://opendatakit.org/use/build) a data collection form or survey;
  * [Collect](http://opendatakit.org/use/collect) the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and
  * [Aggregate](http://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate) the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats.

In addition to socio-economic and health surveys with GPS locations and images, ODK is being used to create decision support for clinicians and for building multimedia-rich nature mapping tools. See [featured deployments](http://opendatakit.org/about/deployments) and [list of tools](http://opendatakit.org/about/tools) for more examples of what the ODK community is doing. We welcome and encourage [participation](http://opendatakit.org/participate) from the user community.

**Downloads of the tools are available at [Downloads](http://opendatakit.org/downloads).**
