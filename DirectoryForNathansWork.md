The G2L (global2local) Interpreter Connect server component is located here:
https://github.com/UW-ICTD/G2L-Interpreter-Connect-Server
(Rather than trying to reuse the interpreter connect server I would suggest making a Django app. I didn't know about Django's built-in admin interface at the time I built the PHP admin interface. It would probably be easier to make something new with Django than to work with what I made and your code will be easier to work with in the future.)
